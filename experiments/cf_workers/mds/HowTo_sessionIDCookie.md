#  HowTo: make a sessionID cookie using Cloudflare workers

```javascript
const addRemembermeSessionCookieHeader ={
  'Set-Cookie': "my-cookie=my-value; Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict; Expires=Mon, 26 Oct 2020 08:33:07 GMT; Max-Age=3600"
}
const addForgetmeSessionCookieHeader ={
  'Set-Cookie': "my-cookie=my-value; Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict; Max-Age=3600"//60sec*60min=1hour
}
const deleteSessionCookieHeader ={
  'Set-Cookie': "my-cookie=my-value; Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict; Max-Age=0" }
```

A session is controlled by the server. Cookies are used to mark the browser in the eyes of the server. HTTP Cookies that are set in the response header from the server to the browser, and then returned from the browser to the server in the request header.

HTTP cookies enable cloudflare workers (the server) to store and receive state in the browser (the client). The cookie itself is a simple keyString=>valueString. The cookie has several other properties that control its expiration time and the access to the cookie from tabs/iframes in the browser loaded from other servers. RFC 6265 require the web browser to store from 50 cookies per domain with the size of each(including attributes) from 4096 bytes. Developers should expect that the browser and the user can delete cookies almost at random.

## SessionID cookie

> Session: a set of interactions between f.x. a user and an application that take place within a given timeframe.

HTTP cookies can manage a session that takes place between:
1. a cf worker (server app),
2. a user,
3. a (trusted) browser, and
4. an HTML/JS app in the browser.

When we use HTTP cookies to control a session between these four actors, we call it a sessionID cookie. A sessionID cookie is a secure cookie, and we will describe here how to secure them. 

Note. As a developer of a web application that runs both on a server and in the browser, you not only need to trust your own application, but also your user and the browser. To trust the user is most often intuitive. You trust your user not to do any malicious actions against his/her own data, but you don't trust your users with other users' data. But. When the browser also controls half of the web app, you must also trust that the particular browser that your user uses/trusts. This article is mostly about when and why you can trust the browser with 'secret data' between your web app on the server and your user working with them in the browser.

## Demo: Cf worker setting and getting secure sessionID cookie

```javascript
function html(txt) {
  return `
<h1>${txt}</h1><br>
<a href="/logoutCookie">logoutCookie</a><br>
<a href="/forgetMeCookie">forgetMeCookie</a><br>
<a href="/rememberMeCookie">rememberMeCookie</a><br>
<a href="/rollingCookie">rollingCookie</a><br>
<a href="/${Math.random()}">hello sunshine</a><br>`;
}

const secureCookieSettings = {
  Domain: '2js-no.workers.dev',
  Secure: true,
  HttpOnly: true,
  SameSite: 'Strict'
};    //remember, NO support for HTTP TRACE from your server!!!

function getCookieValue(cookie, key) {
  return cookie?.match(`(^|;)\\s*${key}\\s*=\\s*([^;]+)`)?.pop();
}

function cookieToStr(cookie) {
  return Object.entries(cookie).map(([k, v]) => k + '=' + v).join('; ');
}

async function handleRequest(request) {
  const url = new URL(request.url);
  const [ignore, action] = url.pathname.split('/');

  //setting normal cookie
  const cookie =
    action === 'logoutCookie' ? {iat: Date.now(), 'Max-Age': 0} :
      action === 'forgetMeCookie' ? {iat: Date.now()} :
        action === 'rememberMeCookie' ? {iat: Date.now(), 'Max-Age': 60 * 1} :
          undefined;
  if (cookie) {
    const fullCookie = cookieToStr(Object.assign(cookie, secureCookieSettings));
    return new Response(html(action + ' cookie: ' + fullCookie), {
      status: 201,
      headers: {'Content-type': 'text/html', 'Set-Cookie': fullCookie}
    });
  }

  //setting rolling cookie
  const cookies = request.headers.get('cookie');
  const iatString = getCookieValue(cookies, 'iat');
  const [iatDate, maybeRoll] = iatString?.split('.') || [];
  const iat = new Date(parseInt(iatDate || Date.now()));
  const roll = maybeRoll === 'roll';
  if (roll || action === 'rollingCookie') {
    const cookie = {iat: Date.now() + '.roll', 'Max-Age': 60 * 1};
    const fullCookie = cookieToStr(Object.assign(cookie, secureCookieSettings));
    return new Response(html('rolling cookie: ' + iat.toUTCString() + fullCookie), {
      status: 201,
      headers: {'Content-type': 'text/html', 'Set-Cookie': fullCookie}
    });
  }
  return new Response(html('hello cookie: ' + iat.toUTCString()), {
    status: 201,
    headers: {'Content-type': 'text/html'}
  });
}

addEventListener('fetch', e => e.respondWith(handleRequest(e.request)));
```

The demo worker has three handles: `/setCookie`, `/deleteCookie`, and everything else.
1. when the worker `setCookie`, it adds a `Set-Cookie` header to the response with a expiration date 1 day into the future. This is typically done when the user logs in.
2. when the worker `deleteCookie`, it adds a `Set-Cookie` header to the response with an expiration date set to *now*. This will remove the cookie from the browser, and is typically done when the user logs out.
3. all other requests to the worker, will simply make the cookie worker print out the content of the cookie it receives from the browser.    

## HowTo: secure a cookie? 

Cookie settings are set as attributes after the cookie name and value in the `Set-Cookie` header. Cookie attributes are `key=value` pairs separated by a `;`. To secure a cookie, the following properties MUST BE set:

1. `Secure`. The cookie will only be added when the browser and server uses `https`. Any cookie that is not `Secure` will be completely unsafe, and cannot be used to store any type of secret or private information. Keep cookies `Secure` by default. Browsers default: `Secure=false`.

2. `Httponly`. The cookie cannot be accessed from JS, not even by the scripts from the domain that issued the cookie. Browsers default: `HttpOnly=false`.

3. `SameSite=Strict`. The cookie will only be sent from the browser to the client when the script that sends the request is from the same domain. This means that scripts loaded from other sites cannot dispatch the registered cookie if they do a `fetch` for example. Browser default: `SameSite=Lax`.

4. `Domain=.example.com`. The cookie will only be sent from the browser when the request is made to a resource under the specified domain and all its subdomains. This ensures that the cookie is not dispatched to other servers. Super cookies with domains such as `.com` are disallowed. 

Note. It is not possible to set a cookie for domains that are two levels up, ie. if your worker runs from `my-worker.my-project.workers.dev`, you can only set `Domain=my-project.workers.dev`, if you try to set a cookie two levels up such as `Domain=workers.dev`, it will fail. This means that you can set cookies that affect the parent domain, sibling domains, and all subdomains therein, but not the super domains (`.com`) nor a grandparent domain (a domain two levels up). 

5. `Path=/my/path` is a path that limits the scope of the cookie. It consists of directory components, separated by the symbol /. A cookie is included in requests whose URI starts with the corresponding path components. If no attribute is set, the path is taken from the request URI.

## HowTo: RememberMe or ForgetMe or Rolling cookies?

To make the browser either forget the session when the browser window closes, or remember the user's login even while the browser is shut down, use the `Expires` and `Max-age` attributes on `Set-Cookie`.

1. `Expires`: Date in UTC format: `new Date().toUTCString()`.

2. `Max-age`: TTL in seconds after last `Set-Cookie` directive in a response. If specified, it overrides the expires value.

### ForgetMe cookies 

**ForgetMe cookies**. Commonly known as **session cookies**. They are removed as soon as the browser window closes. 

To create a **forgetMe** cookie, we implement a **session cookie**. We do that by simply NOT setting an `Expires` NOR a `Max-Age` attribute on the cookie. The cookie will then be forgotten as soon as the browser window is closed (closing the tab is not enough, go figure..). If only `Expires` or only `Max-Age` properties is added, the cookie  will also be as a **session cookie**.

### RememberMe cookies 

**rememberMe cookies** are commonly known as **permanent cookies**. They are saved by the browser even while the browser is closed until the `Expires` date or `Max-Age` is reached.

To create a **rememberMe** cookie, we set an `Expire` date for several days into the future, (for example 1 day or 30 days) and `Max-Age` for several seconds. If the browser has already set a rememberMe cookie, we do not overwrite it.

**RememberMe cookies** should not last infinitely. If a **RememberMe** cookie is set up to last for 365 days, then if it leaks, a leaked cookie might be valid for many months. To avoid such problems, **rolling cookies** can be used.   

### Rolling cookies 

**rolling cookies** are a particular type of remember me cookies. Rolling cookies create rolling sessions, a session whose timetolive is automatically extended while the user is active. 

To create a **rolling cookie**, the server/worker sets an `Expire` date or `Max-age` for a medium amount of time into the future: for example 4 hours (a long lunch break) or 10days (a short holiday). While the user remains active, this timeframe is continuously pushed into the future every time the browser interacts with the server. (It is of course possible to only update the session once for example it is halfway spent: for example only give a new 4 hour session once the current rolling session has less than 2hours left on the clock. Such a simple check can dramatically reduce the network overhead needed to extend the rolling cookie on each interaction).

## HowTo: send cookies using `fetch`

The default value for `credentials` is `"same-origin"`. The default for `credentials` wasn't always the same, though. The following versions of browsers implemented an older version of the `fetch` specification where the default was `'omit'`:

 * Firefox 39-60
 * Chrome 42-67
 * Safari 10.1-11.1.2

If you target these browsers, it's advisable to always specify `credentials: 'same-origin'` explicitly with all fetch requests instead of relying on the default:

```javascript
fetch('/users', {
  credentials: 'same-origin'
});
```

## Do user's logout?

You can't rely on users logging out for security: others might come in and use their account when they leave the computer at the library. But, you need to provide users with an active choice of logging out of an app. And the default option is to have a session cookie, not save credentials on a strange machine.
